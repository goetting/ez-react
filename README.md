# ezReact

ezReact offers a small connector to hook up React components with ezFlux stores.  
By wrapping a React component with a connect function, ezFlux state values are assigned to the component's props.

# Install

[NPM](https://npmjs.com):

```sh
$ npm install ez-react --save
```

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```sh
$ yarn add ez-react
```

# Usage

First, a _connect_ function has to be created with a map of stores.  
_connect_ expects a component and an Object that maps store names to an array of state value keys.  
When the store changes, props of the connected component will update automatically.

```JS
// app.js
import { createStore } from 'ez-flux';
import createConnector from 'ez-react';

const blackMesa = createStore({
  state: { status: 'All systems are green.' },
  methods: { runExperiment: () => this.$assign({ status: 'Please stay calm.' }) },
});

export const connect = createConnector({ blackMesa });
```

```jsx
// component.js
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from './app.js';

const BlackMesa = ({ motto, status }) => (
  <div>Welcome to Black Mesa Research Facility.</div>
  <div>"{motto}"</div>
  <div>{status}</div>
);

const ConnectedBlackMesa = connect(
  BlackMesa,
  { blackMesa: ['status'] },
);

export default ConnectedBlackMesa;
```

After mounting the component initially:

```jsx
import BlackMesa from './components/black-mesa';
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(<BlackMesa motto="Working to make a better tomorrow." />, 'bunker-id');

```

Your output will be:

```
Welcome to Black Mesa Research Facility.
"Working to make a better tomorrow."
All systems are green.

```

After triggering the action to run the experiment, anywhere else in your code ...

```JS
blackMesa.runExperiment();
```

... your output will automatically become:

```
Welcome to Black Mesa Research Facility.
"Working to make a better tomorrow."
Please stay calm.

```


### Life Cycle

Life Cycle of a connected Component:

- Parent will mount
- EZWraper will mount
    - Subscription to stores
    - Initial call of all connect listeners
- Connected Component Life Cycle

Please Note:
A component subscribed to a store should not trigger changes on it on construction.
Otherwise the EZWrapper will trigger a state change while rendering.
This will result in the appropriate React warnings.

# API Documentation


### createConnector

A connect function will only be able to use handlers based on the store map given to its creator.

```TS
  type CreateConnect({ [storeName: string]: Object }) => Function;
```

### connect

Will update a given component automatically when a store changes. These updates are conrolled through handlers.  
A handler may be an array of state keys or a function. If a list of state keys was passed, a handler function will be create automatically.  
An object returned by the handler will be assigned to the given component's props.  
Please Note that all handlers will be executed once _onComponentWillMount_.  

```TS
  type Component = Function;
  type Handler = (Store, props: Object) => Object |Â void;
  type Handlers = { [storeName: string]: string[] | Handler };

  type Connect = (Component, Handlers) => Component;
```
